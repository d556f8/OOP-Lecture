# Repository for OOP Class at SCPark
This repository has been created to organize my OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) class at SCPark during the first semester of my sophomore year in 2023. The purpose of this repository is to help me understand OOP concepts independently.

I plan to use this repository to keep track of my coursework, assignments, and projects related to the class. Additionally, I will use this repository to document my learning process and to take notes on important concepts covered in class.

By organizing my materials and documenting my progress, I hope to create a valuable resource for myself and others who may be studying OOP.
